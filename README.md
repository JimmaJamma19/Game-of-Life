# Game-of-Life
Cellular Automata

To be able to see the proper output of the program, some settings may need to be changed on the user's end.

When the project was submitted, the program was able to adjust the output window size and font size on its own (Lines 18 - 27),
however, after updating Visual Studio to 2022, that piece of code no longer appears to do anything.

Changes required:
1) Terminal Startup settings -> Launch Mode : Maximised
                             -> Launch Size : Columns = 900, Rows = 150 (depending on your screen size)
2) Profile -> Defaults -> Appearance -> Font Size : 3 or 2 (depending on your screen size)
